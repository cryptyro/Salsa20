\begin{block}{History}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathbf{eStream}$ : The $Ecrypt$ Stream Cipher Project, called for submissions of stream ciphers in \textit{November 2004}. 
    \item $\mathbf{Salsa20}$ : Family of $256-bit$ stream ciphers designed in 2005 and submitted to $eStream$ by \textit{Daniel J. Bernstein}.
    \item Salsa20 progressed to the \textit{third round} of $eSTREAM$ without any further changes.
    \item The final $eStream$ portfolio, containing four software stream ciphers and four hardware stream ciphers, were announced in April  \textit{2008}.
    \item It is not \textbf{patented}, and Bernstein has written several public domain implementations optimized for common architectures.
