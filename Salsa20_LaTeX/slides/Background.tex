    \begin{itemize}
    \item Use of network based applications are growing at a rapid speed.
    \item \textit{Pseudo-random} numbers are at the core of any network security application.
    \item \textit{Osvik}, \textit{Shamir} and \textit{Tromer} used cache-timing attacks to steal $AES$ keys from a Linux disk-encryption device.
    \item Serious key collision \& leakage in the hardware implementation of AES ciphers was found.
    \item $A.Shamir$, $I.Mantin$ and $S.fluhrer$ revealed weaknesses in key scheduling algorithm of $RC4$.
    \item Cipher should be \textbf{"GENERIC"} compatible on both Hardware and Software platforms.
\end{itemize}

This way $Salsa20$ came to the picture
