\frametitle{The Doubleround function}

If $x$ is a $16$-word sequence then $doubleround(x)$ is a $16$-word sequence.
\begin{block}{Definition}
A ${doubleround}$ function is the composition of $columnround$ followed by the $rowround$ function, So we have 
$$doubleround(x)  \ = \ 
rowround(columnround(x))$$
